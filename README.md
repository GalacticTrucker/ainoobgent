# AI Agent Calculator Project

This project implements a simple calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions provided as command-line arguments.  It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Usage

To run the calculator, execute `main.py` with the expression as a command-line argument:

```bash
python main.py "3 + 5 * 2"
```

The output will be a JSON string containing the original expression and the calculated result:

```json
{
  "expression": "3 + 5 * 2",
  "result": 13
}
```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main entry point of the application. It parses the command-line arguments, evaluates the expression, and prints the result.
- `pkg/calculator.py`: Contains the `Calculator` class, which is responsible for evaluating mathematical expressions. It supports the operators +, -, *, and /.
- `pkg/render.py`: Contains the `format_json_output` function, which formats the result as a JSON string.
- `tests.py`: Contains unit tests for the calculator.

## Dependencies

- No external dependencies are required.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, execute:

```bash
python tests.py
```

## Notes

- The calculator evaluates expressions using the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
- The calculator handles spaces in the expression.
